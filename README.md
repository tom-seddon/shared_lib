Miscellaneous grab bag of code that's proven its worth over the years.
Mostly pulled out of https://github.com/tom-seddon/b2, but tested
along the way in some other projects.

# Licence

GPL v3 to you. See gpl-3.0.txt.

I may relicence this to myself on non-FOSS terms but will try to keep
the GPL copy up to date with anything useful (if only so that b2 can
use it).
